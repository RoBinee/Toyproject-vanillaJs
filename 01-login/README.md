# Login Toy Project

This is my frist time to write README

But still I don't know what should I put in this file.

~~And this project is too **small** to write many things in README~~
<br></br>

## Why? -> To use my basic skills!

---

I've been practicing to make same things in Javascript. It sounds dumb right?

Because I believe making basic things will help me a lot in long term.

but I realized I never made anything for myself. I was too passive.

So I started to build something using what I learned
<br></br>

## What kind of factor I used

---

1. Pop-up (modal-overlay)
2. Use localStorage
3. Click event -> change the images
4. Use module type for data (imgData.js)
5. Media HTML CSS
   <br></br>

## The problem I met

---

- How to use Github
- Set the image in background full

When I set height 100%, scroll bar happens ->

(solution) Add display: block to img element.

By default, img element has display: inline as default display style. And inline and inline-block display style will apply a blank space between elements.

- Try to change url in Javascript

First I set img background using url in css. But I found that there is a easier way to change img in Javascript. It was to set img element and change src.
