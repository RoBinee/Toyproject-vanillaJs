# Sidebar toy project

## Why?

I learned how to make sidebar & navbar so I was trying to make side bar.

I chose this kind of sidebar when I saw the youtube sidebar.

## Note for remake

About changPadding function, I want to change margin instead of padding.

Actually I wanted to change margin-left but I have no idea how to set width in that situation..because 100% - 33px this kind of things can't be done in JS
